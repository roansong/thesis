\section{Nearest Neighbour Classification}
The steps necessary to implement the NN on the MSTAR dataset are as follows:\\

\begin{itemize}
\item Convert the raw + header MSTAR files into .tiff images
\item figure out how to read and display these images in matlab
\item write a pixel-by-pixel comparison method
\item test the method by comparing one image to itself and others
\item collate a set of mixed radar targets for testing
\item extract data from each image/filename to help with seeing if the classification is correct
\item TEST
\item collect results!
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{}
After testing the Nearest Neighbour algorithm on a set of single-target data, it is necessary to see how well the algorithm performs when other targets are added to the mix. A subset of 10 images of each target is selected, and added to the testing pool.

A system needs to be made that automates the rotation of images and testing, in order to test the Leave-One-Out cross-verification accuracy.

After rescaling the images, predictive accuracy dropped to just 6/70. This is because scaling the images without accounting for the effects of their size leads to smaller images having a much smaller cumulative distance. Weighting the distance result by the number of pixels in an image rectified this immediately, bringing the predictive accuracy up to 56/70!

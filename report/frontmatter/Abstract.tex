\begin{centerpage}{Abstract}
 
 Identifying targets present in radar images is critical to many military and commercial ventures. Using deep learning techniques for classification of radar imagery is an avenue that can use further exploration. Deep learning classifiers will be assessed and compared to na\"ive classifiers. The techniques applied in this report are applied to the MSTAR dataset of radar targets, which is publically available.

\chapter{Conclusions}

The objective of this report was to assess the effectiveness of deep learning techniques in classifying radar images from the MSTAR dataset, with the goal of designing a classifier that can identify radar targets in real-time. This goal was achieved, and all design specifications were met. The Multilayer Perceptron classifier was able to achieve 100\% classification accuracy against the MSTAR dataset, with access to 4459 images allocated between training and testing. 

Even given the success of the Multilayer Perceptron, further development is always possible, through the collection of more data points and the implementation of more complex classifiers. The next logical step would be to implement a Convolutional Neural Network, which deals well with images that are not perfectly centred, as they are in the MSTAR datset.

Acknowledging the success of the Multilayer Perceptron in classifying MSTAR radar targets, I can heartily recommend that this classifier be considered in future target recognition activities.
